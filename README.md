## Objectives:
 

In order to utilize the free time bestowed upon me during these uncertain times, I decided to spend a couple hours each day to learn something new. I wanted to gain some exposure to backend development. Instead of taking a certificate course, I tried a top-down approach to learning. This project is the result of this attempt.
